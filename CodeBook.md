### About the data

The data was taken from analysing 30 people (subjects) doing 6 activities with an attached smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) which measured sensor signals. The subject column is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30. The activity column has 6 different activity types numbered:
1.            WALKING
2.        WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3.        WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4.            SITTING
5.           STANDING
6.             LAYING

### tidydata

The tidydata.txt contains the result of the runAnalysis.R script which contains the columns:
